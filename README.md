This project is a web-based application that allows you to explore graph algorithms using interactive visualizations. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with libraries like Bootstrap, Vis.js, and Font Awesome.

## Usage

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-project.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Interact with the graph controls to create graphs, perform searches, and explore graph algorithms.

## Features

- **Graph Controls**: Create directed and undirected graphs, generate random graphs, and clear graphs.
- **Search Controls**: Search for routes between nodes and visualize the paths.
- **Graph Display**: View the graph and its nodes and edges visually.
- **DFS Traversal**: Perform Depth-First Search (DFS) on the graph and visualize the traversal.
